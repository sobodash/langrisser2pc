Eeeek!<>

Hey, woman!
If you don't want to die, answer
my questions!<clsr>
Does a girl named Liana live in
this house?<>

Y.... yes...<>

!? <>

Captain Leon!<clsr>
We found the girl we've been
searching for!<>

Ah, thank goodness.<>

We should hurry. The local Lord's
troops are on their way here.<>

I see...<>

Hurry up, Baldo!
If the Lord's army shows up,
there will be trouble.<>

Understood!<>

Erwin, this is serious!<>

What's the matter, Hein?<>

Soldiers of the Rayguard Empire
have invaded the village!<>

What...?! Hein!<clsr>
They're attacking the outskirts
of the village!!<clsr>
Isn't that where you said your
childhood friend lives?<>

That's right!<clsr>
She'll be in great danger if we
don't hurry. Will you lend me a
hand?<>

Yes, of course.
Let's go!<>

This is pretty dangerous, Erwin!<clsr>
The Imperials are planning to
take Liana!<>

Why all of this for one person...?<clsr>
There is no time to think about
it.
We have to hurry and help her!<>

Ridel!
They are extremely poweful!<clsr>
But we have to hold them off
until his Lordship arrives to
help us!<>

That's right.<clsr>
I will try and hold them back with
my pikemen, but... <clsr>
What I had heard about their being
the strongest knights in the land
may be no idle rumor, after all...<>

Evan...ze...<>

Ridel...<>

I'm here to rescue you!<>

Thank you for your offer, but
please, save yourselves!<>

Liana!
I'll save you!<>

Hein! Please don't come any closer!<>

Okay, mission accomplished.
Let's return to headquarters.<>

Erwin, eh?
...Mind your own business, kid!<clsr>
You haven't the skill to fight
with me!
Ha ha ha!<>

Gah...this shouldn't be...
possible...<>

I knew it, Erwin!
They're here to kidnap Liana!<>

All right...<clsr>
Focus your attacks on their
commander, Baldo...<>

At this rate Liana will be
kidnapped.<clsr>
Focus your attack on their
commanding officer, Baldo.<>

In the middle of the woods, there
is a small plaza where cute dwarves
are dancing merrily.<clsr>
One of the dwarves comes out and
offers you a berry.<>

Will you eat the berry?<>

Magic defence raised!<>

There is a dresser with one drawer
open.
Inside, you see a blue potion.<>

Will you drink it?<>

You feel a surge of power!<clsr>
AT raised by 1 point!<>

Argh...
not here...<>

That's far enough!<>

Ah! Stay back!
Just forget about me and escape!<clsr>
Why should those who have nothing
to do with me suffer as well...?<>

Wait! I'll see to it that you're
rescued.<>

I won't let you get away with
this!!<>

I couldn't do it...
Erwin, the rest is up to you!<>

You damned Imperials!
Get out of this village!<>

Help!<>

Captain Leon! What should we do
with this villager?<clsr>
Nobody was supposed to discover
our actions here.<>

Do not carry out any wanton
destruction of life.<clsr>
We did not come here to commit
murder.<>

Your duty is to arrange for Baldo's
safe retreat!<>

Yes sir!<>

To all hands!
From here on, pointless killing
is forbidden.<>

At ease. Our mission is not murder.<>

...Yes, sir...<>

Hey, you! move it!!
You're in my way!<>

Eek! Help me!!<>

Baldo, wait! You are not to act
without orders!<>

Evanze, let's go!<>

Yes, it's up to us.<>

I will protect this village with
my life!<>

Are you mocking me!?<>

Evanze.... <clsr>
I'm sorry... <>

Nooo!!<clsr>
Ridel, you mustn't die!
We had a promise!<clsr>
You said we'd be together...<clsr>
.........
forever...<>

Ridel....<>

Kyaa!<>

Evanze!
Hang on!<>

....I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me...<clsr>
I couldn't keep my promise to be
with you..<>

What are you saying?!<clsr>
You're all right, it's just a
small wound!<>

Ridel.... <clsr>
I...love you.<clsr>
..Ri... del..<>

Evanzeeee!<>

Unforgivable... <clsr>
I can never forgive you!<clsr>
I'll kill you with my own two
hands!<>

All right, let's go and give Baldo
some backup!<>

Yes sir!<>

Leyad, follow me!!
I will sweep out the enemy!<>

Understood!<>

Im-...Impossible!!<clsr>
How can I, the leader of the
Blue Dragon Knights, possibly
lose...?<>

Why?<clsr>
Why are the Blue Dragon Knights
going after just one village girl?<>

We shall not divulge our mission
to those not involved.<>

I've heard that the Blue Dragon
Knights are not only the strongest
knights in the land...<clsr>
But that they are also the ones
who value chivalry the most...
So why do they now engage in
an act such as this?!<>

Keep going, Captain Leon!<>

Be careful, Leyad.
The enemy unit consists of
pikemen.<>

I'll break through with a
wave-formed attack, and aim for
their commander.<>

Do your best.<>

Captain Leon!<>

Don't be foolhardy!
I'll handle the rest!!<>

Pathetic!<clsr>
It takes more than a band of pike
to make Blue Dragon Knights flinch!<>

Interesting...
Let's see you prove it!<>

You must be Liana.<clsr>
Come with us quietly to the
Imperial Capital, and nobody
will get hurt.<>

Wh...What...do you want with me?<>

I'm sorry for how sudden this is.<clsr>
I am Leon, the commander of the
Rayguard Empire's Blue Dragon
Knights.
I was sent here to retrieve you.<>

Me...?<>

His majesty, Kaiser Bernhardt,
awaits you.<clsr>
I'll escort you to the Imperial
Capital.<>

......<clsr>
Do you promise that you'll leave
the villagers alone if I follow?<>

Of course.<clsr>
It is already dishonorable to be
seen kidnapping a woman.<clsr>
I have no intention of shaming
ourselves further by killing
defenseless people.<clsr>
However, those who direct their
swords against us shall forfeit
this assurance of safety.<>

I understand...<clsr>
I will follow you under those
conditions,then.<>

...I'm sorry for this.
Thank you for your cooperation.<>

Let's go, little girl!
Hurry up and follow me!<>

Sigh... A mission without
swordplay just isn't any fun...<clsr>
Maybe I can have some fun with
the young girls over there!<>

Stop it! That wasn't part of our
agreement!<>

Shut it!<clsr>
With you under arrest, that
promise holds no meaning.<>

Well then...
Let's take her to headquarters.<clsr>
However...
Baldo, do be polite to her.<>

Yes, Sir...
I'll take care from now on.<>

Wait!<clsr>
You can't do as you please in
this village!<>

Captain Leon!
The local militia has come!<>

How quickly...
But it makes no difference.<clsr>
Continue the mission as planned!<>

What was that!?
I'll make you regret ever coming
to this village!<>

Sigh...how foolish...<>

Come on,
get over here!<>

Ouch! I'll follow, but don't pull
so hard!<>

Damn, an impudent little wench,
ain't ya?<clsr>
The things I have to put up with.
Shit!<>

You must be stupid to pick a fight
with Baldo, kid!<clsr>
You must not know who you're going
up against!
I'm going to enjoy playing with
you!<>

Impossible...<clsr>
Captain Leon!<>

What!?
How could Baldo have been
defeated...?<>

Leyad!<>

Yes, sir!<>

We must go and escort the girl
ourselves.<clsr>
We must bring her to the
Imperial capital.<>

Yes Sir!<>

What?! How could we have failed?<>

I came as soon as I heard about
the trouble here... <clsr>
What the?!<>

Amazing...<clsr>
The Blue Dragon Knights are being
held back by those people!<>

Thank goodness.
It seems I was a little late.<>

I am responsible for the welfare
of the people throughout all of
my territory.<>

We must drive off the Imperial
Knights!<>

It's the Lord's army!<>

Enemy reinforcements have arrived!<>

What bad timing...<clsr>
We have no choice but to retreat,
for now!<>

As you command.<>

The enemy's reinforcements have
arrived?!<clsr>
This doesn't look good. We must
retreat!<>

Liana...
We'll be back later..<>

It seems to be over.<>

Thank you for helping me, sir
swordsman.<clsr>
I am Liana, a shrine maiden from
the Shrine of Light.
What is your name?<>

My name is Erwin.
I am on an aimless journey...<>

Lord Erwin,
I really want to thank you.<clsr>
I don't know if I was worth the
rescue effort, but I really do
appreciate it...<>

You really don't have to say such
things...<clsr>
Anyway, are you hurt?<>

No...I'm all right.<clsr>
I should be the one asking
Lord Erwin if you're unhurt...<>

I'm fine.<clsr>
You don't have to call me "Lord
Erwin".
It sounds kind of weird.<clsr>
Just call me Erwin.<>

Well then, you can call me Liana.<>

You were amazing, Erwin!<>

Hein, I also want to thank you for
helping me out.<>

By the way everyone, I'm glad to
hear that nobody is hurt, but
you cannot rest easy just yet.<clsr>
They will surely come back to
finish what they began.
You'll have to take refuge with
me in Salrath...<clsr>
For your own sake as well as
that of the villagers.<>

His Lordship is right.
Let us depart immediately.<>

Wait a moment!<clsr>
I am sorry... I wasn't able to
give you better support...<>

That's not true.<clsr>
We could only fight because you
drew the attention of the
cavalry.<>

Your words are very kind, good
Sir Erwin.<clsr>
I don't know what to say.
Please take this with you.
It's a token of my gratitude.<>

You received 100P!<>

Thanks, I appreciate it.<>

The world is a dangerous place.
It's always better to have some
money...<>

That's true...<>

Well then, let's be on our way
soon.<clsr>
It's getting dark, and I have an
empty stomach!<>

Hein...<>

Very well then, let's be off.<>

I will guide you to the mansion.<>

Baldo's retreat has been secured!<>

......<clsr>
I've never had a mission like
this before.
A soldier of war, to be seen here
abducting a girl...<clsr>
What... disgrace...<>

Please don't let it get to you,
Captain.<clsr>
For me, it's an honor just to
serve under your command.<>

I appreciate your words, but
don't get careless now...<>

...Hmph,
only these two? I alone will be
enough.<>

Stay calm.<clsr>
On the battlefield, you will not
survive if you are not cool-headed.<>

You can't fight well if you get
wounded.<clsr>
Try to place the units under your
command directly around yourself.<clsr>
Your subordinates will recover
some of their physical strength
each turn.<clsr>
Value your soldiers' lives as if
they were your own.<>

I understand.<>

Let's go!!<>

I won't go down that easily!<>

L...Leon, sir...
I am sorry...
Please forgive me...<>

No...!
I allowed a subordinate under
my command to die...<>

Ah...
You fight well!
But for how long...<>

Crap!
You impertinent asshole!<clsr>
I'll kill you for that!<>

Be silent, if you don't know
anything!<clsr>
The Captain is not on this
mission by his own choice!<clsr>
This mission is only being
undertaken because it was a
direct order from Kaiser
Bernhardt himself!!<>

You bastard...<clsr>
You're going to die for getting
on my nerves!<>

It's all right, Leyad.<clsr>
It is disgraceful to make up
excuses for our dishonorable
actions.<clsr>
I can endure the disgrace of a
mission such as this, but it
would be hard on me if you were
to die here...<>

Eeeek!<>

How cruel!
How can you do such a thing?<>

Shut up, girl!
Do you wanna get hurt too?!<>

Stop it!!
You imbecile!<clsr>
I issued an order to refrain from
the useless destruction of life!<clsr>
I won't repeat it again.
Anyone disobeying my commands is
unnecessary to this operation.<>

...Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Captain Leon.<>

How cruel...<>

Remember your promise!<clsr>
Don't harm the people of this
village!<>

I never said anything about
sparing any men who would turn
their swords against us.<>

But...<clsr>
I beg you, please!<clsr>
Just let me go with them to the
Imperial Capital!
If I go with the Imperial Army,
all of this will be over....<>

...I can't... allow that...<>

...How foolish...<>

I...I will fight..<>

I cannot forfeit the lives of
those I love!<>

How foolish..<>

I cannot forgive those who would
interfere...<clsr>
It is the only way!<>

But...<>
