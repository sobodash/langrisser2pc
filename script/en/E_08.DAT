What?!
You still haven't
finished yet?!<>

... If this isn't
done in time...<clsr>
What'll Lady Imelda
do to me?<>

Anyways, hurry!<clsr>
If we take out that
bridge, it'll block
the Kalxath
army's advance.<clsr>
Dismantle that
bridge before they
get here!<>

Oh no!...
Imperial soldiers!<>

Curses!
You're earlier than
I thought!<clsr>
I, Kr{2E}mer of the
Imperial Forces Ice
Dragon Army,<clsr>
shall let you
advance no further!<>

The Imperial forces
have made it
this far...<clsr>
Their strength is
great, indeed.<>

They've heavily
fortified the
border... <clsr>
I must apologize.<>

It's all right,
Keith. It can't
be helped.<clsr>
The last battle
proved our forces
were insufficient.<clsr>
There's no time to
find another way...<clsr>
And I'm worried
about the stronghold
up ahead.<clsr>
Let's hurry.
We have to
get past them!<>

{02}! Let's
break through
their lines!<>

Yeah.<clsr>
The Empire is
probably searching
for Langrisser as
we speak.<>

All right!
Let's go, everyone!<>

The enemy has flying
units... <clsr>
We should be careful.
They move quickly
and could easily
surround us.<>

That's right.<clsr>
But they could be
easily defeated
by Elves.<clsr>
Flying troops are
very weak versus
bow attacks.<>

Is that so?
You know so much,
Hein.<>

Huh?<clsr>
Cherie, you didn't
know that about
flying units?<>

I... I knew that!
I just...<>

Princess, you can't
survive without that
knowledge.<clsr>
I've been telling
you every day you
should study
military tactics.<>

It's so boring
to study.<clsr>
The best way to
learn is through
real battle.<>

So, you didn't know
that, after all.<>

Sh... Shut up!<>

Lure them all into
the middle of the
bridge and attack!<>

Yes, sir!<>

You still haven't
collapsed the bridge?<>

No, not yet.<>

Well, hurry it up!
We can't let them
take another step!<>

Yes!<>

Hmmm.
Haven't you
collapsed it yet?<>

Not yet.
It's sturdier than
it looks.<>

Hurry, hurry!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Lord Kr{2E}mer,
we're almost done.<>

Do it quickly!<clsr>
The enemy is
stronger than
we thought.<>

Not too long now!
The bridge is almost
dismantled!<>

All right, hurry up!<>

Everyone, hurry!
We're almost at the
end of the bridge!<>

Watch out for those
airborne units...<clsr>
This is where their
maneuverability
works most in
their favor.<clsr>
We've got to stop
their leader.<>

Let's hurry!
There's only one
rope left!<>

Everyone! hurry!
There's only one
rope left!<>

This is our last
chance to break
through!<clsr>
Everyone, charge!<>

This will be the
decisive blow!<clsr>
Concentrate all
attacks on
the leader!<>

Haven't you
finished yet?!<>

Yes, sir!
Preparations
are complete!<clsr>
Ready to remove
the bridge!<>

All right then,
proceed!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Hahaha!
This will stop them
for good!<clsr>
Glory to the Empire!<>

You know, it's
pretty daring of the
Imperials to form<clsr>
an army composed
solely of flying
units.<>

Even in closed
ranks, <clsr>
they can freely
adapt their
formation to the
situation at hand...<clsr>
Shows quite a bit of
tactical knowledge
on their part,
don't you think?<>

Damn!
They've made it
this far... <clsr>
Engineering forces!
The bridge still
hasn't fallen?!<clsr>
If you don't hurry
this up, they'll
get across!<>

There's the entrance
to a cave here,
oddly enough.<clsr>
Let's leave it for
now. We can check
it out later.<>

You notice a small
sapling nestled
within a group of
four trees.<clsr>
Hidden under the
sapling, you find a
little sprite
watching you.<clsr>
Will you try to
speak to it?<>

Smile at it<>

Scare it<>

Don't say anything<>

You're a funny guy.
I'll give you some
of my power!<>

MDF raised!<>

I don't like you!<clsr>
The sprite 
disappears.<>

Without saying
anything, the
sprite disappears.<>

Let's go!<>

Ghh... Is this it?.. <>

Aaalright!
Let's gooo!<>

Oh... I have...
been.. defeated...<>

Don't get in my way!<>

I... I can't go on
any more... <>

Sorry, everyone...<>

We can't let the
Imperials just walk
all over us!<>

Urgh...
Such dishonor...<>

Hey, hey! Prepare
for my onslaught!<>

Sorry!
Please fight on in
my name...<>

Okay... Now!
All squads, commence
the attack!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Just a bit more...<clsr>
Just a little more
time wasted and
they'll be ours!<clsr>
I can do it by
myself if
I have to!<>

Just a little more...<clsr>
Just a little more
time wasted and
they'll be ours!<clsr>
We must not lose.
Everyone back me up!<>

Ugh...
Operation failed... <clsr>
Must report
to Lady Imelda.<>

Ugh...
Operation failed... <clsr>
Must report
to Lady Imelda.
Everyone, retreat!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Yes, sir!<>

We've wasted
a lot of time.<>

{02}!
Let's hurry!<clsr>
There must be some
reason why those
Imperial jerks tried
to drop that bridge.<>

We certainly must
hurry. The Empire is
after Langrisser.<>

Let's get to the
stronghold,
quickly!<>

They may have the
stronghold
under siege...<>

Yeah...
Could be.<clsr>
But don't worry.
My sensei is at
the base.<>

Oh, really?<clsr>
Well then, we can
rely on him, if he's
the one who<clsr>
made you such a
tough, brawny
swordswoman.<>

Hein!
You!.. <clsr>
How could you call a cute
girl like me "tough" and
"brawny"?<>

Right, {02}?<>

Aah... yeah.<>

No, those are
the right
words!<clsr>
You're cute,
Cherie, but
you're also
one tough girl!<>

...... <clsr>
... That's enough.
Anyway, let's hurry.<>

Hmm.., I just
remembered I saw a
cave by the cliff.<clsr>
What should we do?..<>

Will you examine the
cliff opening?<>

Let's have a look at
it. I feel uneasy
leaving it unchecked.<>

But we really don't
have time to
look around.<>

I know.<clsr>
But there might be
something there of
help in our battle
against the Empire.<>

Well, {02},
if you say so, I
guess it's all right.<>

All right, everyone!
Let's check out that
opening!<>

We'd better just
hurry on.<>

All right! Let's
go, everyone!<>

I'll show you the
power of the
Imperial Army!<>

Ghh!<>

L..Lord Kr{2E}mer...<>

Feel the power of
the Ice Dragon
Army!<>

Ghh...
I can't hang on
any more...<>

Khh...
What a mistake I
made!...<>

Haha, die!<>

Augh...
Too strong...<>

Long live
the Emperor!<>

Ugh!
This is it...<>

Argh!
I'm finished...<>

Ahh!
Blood... blood...<>

Impossible!
How could I...<>

Ugh...The troops
Lady Imelda
entrusted to me... <clsr>
Well, even if I'm
the last one
standing, I won't
let you pass!<>

Kya!
It's frightening,
but I must go on...<>

N... not bad, huh!<>

Clearly, their goal
was to stay 
ur advance.<clsr>
I fear for
the stronghold.<clsr>
And this likely gave
them time to find
Baltia, too.<>

You'll go no further!<>
