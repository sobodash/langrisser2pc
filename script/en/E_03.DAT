Did everyone sleep
well yesterday?<>

Yeah.
I slept soundly.<>

Not bad.
I managed to get a nice rest.<>

Please leave Liana to me.<clsr>
Even if it is the Imperial Army,
it doesn't seem likely they'd
attack this shrine.<>

Huh?<clsr>
Priest, where have the shinto
warriors gone to?
I didn't see them around here.<>

A group of monsters recently
attacked a nearby village.
They left to drive them out.<>

Please take good care of Liana.<clsr>
But why is the Imperial Army
after her?<clsr>
Does the fact that she's a
shrine maiden of light have
something to do with it?<>

... <clsr>
Well...
I don't know.<>

I think there's something about
Liana the Blue Dragon Knights
are after...<>

Great priest! We're in trouble!
The Imperial Army's here!<>

What!<>

What is your business on this
holy land?<>

I am Commander Zorum of the
Blazing Dragon Army, the right
hand of General Vargas.<clsr>
Would you be so kind as to hand
over the tablet in the shrine?<>

I heard that your aim is the
tablet about the sealing of
Alhazad!<clsr>
If this is true then I won't let
you have it!<>

Well then, I'll take it from you
using brute force!<>

You can take the old man and the
others, Zorum.<clsr>
Leave the young girl to me...
Uwahahaha... <clsr>
Oh?<>

?!<>

Isn't that the girl the Blue
Dragon Knights are looking for?<clsr>
How convenient! Since we're
here let's take her too.<clsr>
Uwahahaha...<>

The situation just keeps getting
worse, doesn't it? <clsr>
Even though he's in the Blazing
Dragon Army, Zorum is called the
right hand of General Vargas.<clsr>
Morgan is from a group organized
by first-class black magic
masters, the Black Dragon Dark
Priests.<clsr>
Both of them look pretty strong.<>

Liana!
Stay where you are!<>

All right!<>

Morgan, let's take them out in
one sweep!<>

Let's not.
By the way stop calling me that.<clsr>
You're supposed to call me
"MASTER Morgan."<>

This time I'M the superior
officer here.<clsr>
If you hate being addressed
without a title, I'll call 
you "Little Morgan" or something
like that.<>

Argh!
You muscle-bound fool!<>

What was that!!?
I won't be called a fool by a
wacko like you!<>

Argh!!! You bastard~!!! I
hate - hate - hate - hate
hate - hate - hate - hate...<clsr>
hate - hate - hate - hate
hate - hate - hate - hate
hate - hate - hate - hate...<clsr>
HATE YOU! DAMNIT!!!<>

Huh?
They're not getting along very
well, are they?<>

Eh? You're wasting time!
I don't care WHAT you are, just
hurry and attack!<>

The enemy will probably use
Dark Elves.<clsr>
They'e capable of long-range
attacks, so be careful!<>

Elves's have rather weak defense,
don't they?<>

Yes. Because of that, they can
be quickly defeated by a direct
attack.<>

Hmm...
Their attack power isn't very
high either, right?<>

Yes, that's right.
Troops with high defense should be
able to fight them safely.<>

Is that right... <clsr>
As long as we avoid their
long-range attacks, there's little
to fear.<>

Scott's knows a whole lot, doesn't
he?<>

My father taught me battle tactics
to the point where I could take no
more.<>

Really,
What a stubborn bunch!<>

Eehehehe!
I'll take those to be words of
praise!<>

You know, you're really annoying.<>

DAMNIT!<>

Looks like this stubborn group bit
off more than they could chew!<clsr>
You can't back out of this!<>

I also just noticed that you're
slow too!<>

Ack!
What's taking him so long?!<clsr>
Zorum!
Take them out right now!<>

Many of our troops lust for blood.
Since the enemy is so few, they
won't fight.<clsr>
Even while I'M in charge of this
unit.
I won't forgive such selfish
behavior!<>

Damn you!<clsr>
WIMPY, WIMPY!
WIMPY, WIMPY!
WIMPY, WIMPY!
WIMPY, WIMPY!<clsr>
Who the hell would
take orders from you?!<>

... damn, you have a good eye!<>

What's that!?
Don't remember you being able to
say such a thing!<>

But I would have done it
differently.
Why don't you give me some orders?<clsr>
I was originally a mercenary so
we'll see whether or not your
commanding ability is the genuine
article!<clsr>
Well, what's the plan, boss?<>

... Interesting!
I'll show you our way of
fighting!<>

Then we're in agreement.
Well then, order away!<>

Rohga joins the party!<>

Everyone, be careful.<clsr>
Although Kalxath has won several
battles against the Imperial Army,
they're not going to be easy.<>

We're in trouble, Erwin!<clsr>
It's an ambush by the Imperial
Army!<>

Ha Ha Ha!
That's what's called a strategy!
Go and get us that tablet!<>

Everyone!
Don't let the Imperial Army into
the shrine!<>

OK, I'll try my best to fulfill
your request!<>

It's an ambush! Everyone!
Don't let the Imperial Army enter
the shrine!<>

While walking in the forest, you
come across a clearing.<clsr>
At its center, you find a place
lit by sunlight that filters
through the trees.<>

Do you want to try digging here?<>

Found Speedboots!<>

Graaaaaah!!!<clsr>
You bastards! I'll never forget
your faces!<>

That's as far as you go!<>

Shit...
I never expected this...<>

Don't go easy on me!<>

Aaugh!
Already can't do any more...
I'm sorry, Erwin.<>

I'll show you my superb fighting
skills!<>

I'm sorry.
I have to resign.<>

Kyaa!<>

Aaah... Erwin...<>

It can't be...
It can't be that...<>

Well then, girl!
Kill that guy!<>

Stop!
Don't you recognize me?!<>

Uwaha!
It's useless.
Why don't you just give up!<>

Must obey...<>

Aaah... Erwin...<>

Uwahaha!
Die, Die!
Diiiiiieeeeee!!<>

Damn it!
The shrine maiden of light is...!<>

It can't be...
It can't be that... <clsr>
Liana...
Uwaaaaaaaa!<>

Liana was the one who controlled
the fate of many people...<clsr>
Regrettably, because she died,
the seal on the evil sword
Alhazad was undone for eternity.<clsr>
The Rayguard Empire recieved the
evil sword's power, mobilized its
entire army, but collapsed in the
end.<clsr>
Now, countries that dreamed of
continent unification disappeared,
and any order has long since
vanished.<clsr>
After a long time, this continent
became known as a cursed land...<>

Ah... <clsr>
Huh?! I...
I was being controlled...
Everyone...
I'm sor... r... y...<>

Hyaa hya hya hya!
What a lovely turn of events!<clsr>
I owe you all my thanks.<>

Shit!
We should have beat up that guy
first...<>

What's this? 
Isn't that crude!
I got a free night's stay.. <clsr>
Though it's troublesome, I'll do
you all a favor by helping you
out.<>

If it's troublesome, then don't
help us.
Watch our battle from over there!<>

Sounds interesting!
I accept your offer to watch how
skilled you are from here.<>

Well, what should I do, Erwin?<>

Uwaaaa!<>

... unskilled piece of shit!
Damn, you couldn't do anything!<>

My power was said to have been
that strong...<>

Cherie of Kalxath, heading out!<>

... Cherie...?
Have I met her somewhere
before...?<>

... soon we'll also see battle.<clsr>
I'll protect one of the
shrine's entrances.
Entrust the girl you call Liana
to me.<>

Um, thanks.<>

So, what should I do?<>

Protect the right entrance.<>

Protect the left entrance.<>

Stay where you are.<>

Can you protect the right entrance
for me?<>

Okay.<>

Can you protect the left entrance
for me?<>

Understood.<>

Please stay and protect the center
entrance.<>

I got it.<>

I never cared much for the
Imperial Army!<>

Guess I overdid it...
I've got to take a rest.<>

Shrine Maidens,
Take refuge in the inner part of
the shrine!<>

Yes, Priest!<>

Oooh... God...<>

Priest!<>

Liana!
She looks so cold, but this is no
time to be sad!
Come on!<>

Y... yes...<>

Aah, Lushiris-sama...<>

Kyaa!<>

Ugh..
Raw warm blood is as good as I
thought it would be...<>

I won't show any mercy to those
who hinder me!<>

I'll show you how I get things
done!<>

Im, Impossible!
My power, inferior to yours...<clsr>
I won't forget this!<>

Hee hee hee...
I wonder what we should do now.<clsr>
Oh yes, I just remembered an
interesting magical item that
Eggbert gave me.<clsr>
Well then, I'll try it out on
that girl at once!<>

Indeed, a spirit to rule the mind
and heart... <>

...?
... Ah shit, I forgot what comes
after that, but well, that's
alright.<clsr>
Revira Torl Rekseta!<>

Ahh!
My head...<>

Liana!
Are you alright?!<>

Ok, little girl, make that guy
over there a blood sacrifice!<>

......<>

Somehow, it looks like the
magic didn't work completely...<clsr>
Will it ever work right at
least once?<>

Hah!
You know you magic really sucks.
This is so pathetic.<>

DAMNIT!
A muscle-bound fool like you has
no right to say that!<>

If that's the case, then maybe
you like to do some more work for
me, Little Morgan.<>

GOD DAMNIT!
... well, that's alright.<clsr>
However, it seems like you prefer
cowering in back, Commander Zorum. 
Hehehe!<>

What's wrong!?
Hang in there, Liana!<>

No good... <clsr>
Somehow his magic seems to be
making her lose her true self.
What should we do...<>

That man... Morgan has to be
beaten!<clsr>
If we do that, I'm sure Liana will
return to normal.<>

Got it!
If we beat Morgan, everything will
be ok!<>

Uwahahaha!
You gonna beat me with your
fighting spirit?<clsr>
If you want to become a zombie that
much, then I'll grant your wish
right away.<>

Kiiiiiii!
Those who oppose me will die!!<>

Taste the extent of my power!<>

Damnit!
You actually injured me, didn't
you!!<clsr>
I'll make you regret this someday!<>

Ah... <clsr>
Huh?!
I... I...<>

Are you awake?
Since Morgan was wounded, the
spell was broken.<>

I'm sorry, Erwin.<>

Im, Impossible...<>

Gwaoo!<>

Uwaha!
I won't leave anyone standing!<>

Die!!<>

Perfection...
I... gave it my...<>

I failed!
Commander Zorum, I'm sorry...<>

Heh Heh Heh...
Let's go.<>

Heh heh heh...
Die!<>

Not yet,
I can't die yet...<>

Outrageous...<>

Blood... blood is...<>

Graaaaaaaaaah!<>

Cowardly!
Cowardly!
Cowardly!<clsr>
All troops!
Retreat for now!<>

Hmm, well done!
No matter, you have yet to see how
powerful I am!<clsr>
Everyone, charge!<>

Argh!
Slow! Slow! Slow!<clsr>
With a stupid commander like him,
you're not going to get in a
decent attack, much less win.
No way...<>

How dishonorable!
They're going after Liana!
Hurry! Go and help her!<>

Hmph!
Is that all you can do?!<clsr>
Don't make this longer than it
has to be!<>

Oho,
Let's do it.<>

The Empire's after the girl, isn't
it?<clsr>
I see...
If that's so, how about coming to
Kalxath Castle?<>

Hyaa hya hya hya!
How interesting.
You must fight in that condition.<>

Hyaa hya hya hya!
Sweet! Too sweet!<clsr>
You dare oppose me, of the
Imperial Army, with that weak
power!?<>

Hahaha!
How great the power of the Blazing
Dragon Army is!<>

Uwaha!
Be more aggressive!<clsr>
We'll teach you how foolish it is
to resist us!<>

Hold it!<>

Kalxath Castle?..<>

If I remember correctly, Kalxath
just might be able to protect
Liana.<>

That's right.
Kalxath has many strong troops
besides me.<>

I found you, Imperial Army!
I figured you'd be here after the
situation changed!<clsr>
I came so you won't do as you
please!<>

Ack!
Little girl, go home quietly.<clsr>
If you do, we'll spare your young
life.
Hya hya hya!<>

Hya hya hya hya!<>

Wh, What was that!?
You perverted magician!
Keep your eyes off!<>

Yeah,
I'd have to agree with her
regarding that.<>

DAMNIT!<>

Why, some strange girl just
appeared.<>

How rude!
Even though I took all the trouble
coming to help you.<>

... Oh?
You-
You're quite attractive.<>

Should I be a little
high-spirited for your sake?<>

Whaa!?
Who, me?
Ah, I'm sooo embarrassed...<>

Are you stupid!?
Who's talking to you!<>

Shit!<>

...<clsr>
A... Anyways, please help us.<>

Hehe.
He's turning red, how cute!!<>

Damn!
We couldn't protect them...<>

It looks like the battle is over.<>

Thanks for helping out.
I'm Erwin. And you are?<>

My name's Cherie.
Pleased to meet you.<clsr>
The truth is that we, Kalxath,
along with other countries, are
forming an anti-imperialist
group.<clsr>
I heard the Imperial Army was
in the vicinity, so I came here
because of that.<clsr>
However, the empire only came to
attack the shrine of light...
What were they thinking, I
wonder...<>

Ow, ow...<>

Are you all right?
Um...<>

I'm Cherie.
How shameful,
to be beaten like that... <clsr>
I'm from Kalxath who, along
with neighboring countries, are
forming an anti-imperialist
group.<clsr>
I heard the Imperial Army was
nearby, and that was my reason
for coming.<clsr>
However, the empire is only
attacking the shrines of light...
I wonder what they're up to.<>

I... I let myself be controlled
by Morgan and attacked Erwin.<clsr>
Erwin, If you had died...<clsr>
I... I...<>

Don't worry.
Everyone's safe, so it's all
right. Besides...<clsr>
You look better with a
smile...<clsr>
So won't you stop crying,
for me?<>

... Thank you.<clsr>
Erwin, I'm always causing
trouble for you, I'm really
sorry...<clsr>
But, I'll try to look happier.
So, please don't worry about
me...<>

Aw.
Cheer up soon, will ya?<>

Okay.<>

I'm sorry.<clsr>
A little longer and I would have
started attacking everyone here.<>

It's not Liana's fault.
It was because of Morgan's spell.<>

Thank you everyone... for
thinking about me...<>

Oh, I see.
By the way, what should we do
about Liana?<>

Eventually, even the largest
shrine of light won't be enough...<>

What should we do from here?<clsr>
It doesn't seem safe to entrust
her to a shrine of light...<>

So I see.
That might be good.<>

Erwin... um...<>

Huh?
Liana, what is it?<>

Please, let me fight too!<>

No way!
It's dangerous for little girls
to fight!<>

Isn't it more important for me
to endure all this?<clsr>
It was for my sake... that...
that all of you got hurt.<>

I say we approve of it.
Or are you not confident that
you can protect her?<>

......<>

... I understand.<>

Thank you!
Erwin!<>

Liana joins the party!<>

Everything worked out well!
Anyway, I like this guy's spirit!<>

Thanks.
I'm glad.<>

I feel that we'll be great if we
work together.
We'll be rich.<clsr>
I helped you through this. Please
allow me to continue working with
you, Erwin!<>

It is I who should say so.
A partner as strong as you is
quite welcome.<>

Disappointing!<clsr>
Compared to the great stuff I
heard about you, you can't do
anything!<clsr>
Even though you have some good
qualities, you don't do anything
with them!<>

......<>

However, I sense that you'll
do great things.<clsr>
Hmm, together we could become
rich.<clsr>
However, we can't do it with the
way you are now.
Talk with me! I'll teach you
everything!<clsr>
Erwin!
I'll raise you to be a great
leader!<clsr>
I'll expect you to live up to my
expectations.
You're going to cost me a fortune,
you know!<>

......<>

Well then, let's hurry to Kalxath.
I have to tell them of this!<>

Cherie joins the party!<>

Also, I'd like to give you all a
big welcome.<>

Wait up a second!
At least, let me thank you for
helping us...<>

Thanks to you, the shrine was
saved.<clsr>
There's not much we can do for
you without being punished.<>

Please accept this cross.<clsr>
It always brings good luck.<>

You got a Cross!<>

I can't do anything for you but,
I'll pray that you'll have a safe
journey.<>

All right!
Let's go, everyone!<>
