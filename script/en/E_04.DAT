Sir Keith!
Imperial troops have lain
siege to the castle.<>

My experience couldn't
prevent their taking us by
surprise... <clsr>
We must somehow endure until the
princess returns...<>

General Vargas!
It seems our diversionary tactics
have succeeded.<clsr>
Only a small defense force remains
withing Kalxath Castle.<>

Zorum and Morgan seem to
have done well.<clsr>
They work well together.<clsr>
Soldiers of the
Blazing Dragon Army, lets
take the castle down at once!<>

Yes, sir!<>

General Vargas!
The enemy is behind us!<>

What?!<>

Looks like we're not too late.<>

Princess!<clsr>
Everyone, the princess has
returned!<>

Hoorah!<>

Wha?
Princess?...<>

Keith, everyone!
You're all safe.<clsr>
It's just like the Imperial
army to attack us when I'm
not around.<>

What was that?
This is strategy.<clsr>
If you can't recognize such
manuvers then you're a dumbass.<>

D-Dumbass?!
I'll never forvige you for that one!<>

Cherie is the princess of Kalxath...? <clsr>
I think my image of a "princess" is shot...<>

Hein!
What was that?<>

N... nothing...<>

Anyway, we've got to
provide some backup
before the castle falls.<>

Thank you!
I appreciate your help.<>

Finally, a chance to experience
real battle.<clsr>
The Blazing Dragon Army,
the Blue Dragon Knights,
the Black Dragon Dark
Priests,<clsr>
and the Ice Dragon Army are
the main forces of the
Imperial Army.<clsr>
General Vargas is a superior
military officer and
a man to be feared.<clsr>
Since the main detachement
of the Imperial army was
sent here,<clsr>
the empire must be set on
crushing Kalxath.<>

Only Kalxath has enough power
to resist the Empire.<clsr>
It very important to the Empire
to bring down Kalxath.<>

Elite guards, capture the
castle, swiftly!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Everyone remaining, take
out the rear enemy!<>

Understood!<>

Kalxath is the leading nation
of the anti-Imperial league.<clsr>
If we fall, then the allies
will submit to the Empire.<clsr>
If this operation succeeds,
the land will be united
under Imperial control.<clsr>
We can't afford to fail!<>

Somehow, everyone's held
on... so far.<>

Ah.
We need to hurry.<>

Somehow, Kalxath Castle
has endured this long, but...<clsr>
Everyone, we must hurry.<>

Since the enemies are
strong, we should use
magic attacks.<clsr>
Setting up a magic attack
from a distance will give
our soldiers an opening.<clsr>
Unreasonable attacks will
just lead to our soldiers
dying in vain.<>

Ah. I understand.<>

When attacked by the enemy,
try to form a front wall with
troops that the enemy fights<clsr>
poorly against.<clsr>
Don't try to be a hero
and engage the enemy alone.
You'll only recieve attacks
instead of dealing them.<>

After you've stopped the
enemy with that, I should
use Fireball and Attack,
right?<>

That's right. Every enemy
loss will increase our
chances.<>

Through a window, you spot a
bird's nest.<clsr>
Inside some feathers in the nest,
there's a small potion the
color of the sea.<>

Will you drink the potion?<>

DF has increased by 1!<>

Let's go!<>

Feh!
I'll take you all down!<>

Ugh... from here on...<>

Defeated...
I'll be out of battle before
you...<>

Imperial troops!
Don't be so self-assured!<>

Shit!
If only I had more
power...<>

So you're General Vargas of
the Blazing Dragon Army!<clsr>
Let's see how skilled you
really are!<>

Just what I wanted to hear!
But first, tell me
your name.<clsr>
I'll be sure carve it on your
gravestone.<>

Fuck you!
I'm Rohga and
I'll have your head!<>

Hah!
What a brazen kid!<>

Move it!
You weaklings are
in my damn way!<>

I, the strongest mercenary,
am to die here...<>

We do better when we
cooperate.<clsr>
Erwin!
I'll follow your
directions!<clsr>
I leave it up to you!<>

To have fallen at the
castle I came to protect...<>

I can't permit you to
attack my castle!<>

Please!
Take your troops and
leave this country!<>

You're brave, girl.
But you think too highly of
your abilities.<>

I'm sorry...
I...can't... any more...<>

We must battle to the
last man!<>

We will!<>

Princess, I have no
excuse...<>

Keith!<>

We can't lose now that
our princess has returned!<>

This is not a place for you
to trespass.
Go away!<>

P.. Princess...<>

I'll show you what the
Kalxath army can do!<>

Let's see what you can do!<>

I...
can't hold out any more.<>

Don't relax your guard
even if they're just a
frontier country!<clsr>
They're no stranger to battle.<>

Taste the power of an
Imperial General!<>

Let us see the power of the
Kalxath army.<>

Urgh...
I don't think I can go on
from here...<>

Damn, I'm an idiot.
I was too careless...
*cough*<clsr>
I have to retreat!
Everyone, you must
continue the assault!<>

Ghhh... How can this
be?<>

G.. General Vargas...<>

Regrettable... In such a place...<>

I don't want to die...<>

Now let me through!<>

Ghh!..<>

I've served for the glory of
the Rayguard Empire!<>

My vision... blurry...
Alas...<>

Gghhh... not bad...<>

Zorum, retreat! I'll handle
the rest.<>

B.. but, General...<>

I can't let you die in a
battle like this.<clsr>
Retreat and reorganize your
troops.<clsr>
Don't worry, I'll decide
where you die.<>

W.. well then,
I'm retreating...<>

You kids!
Don't think you've
won!<>

Oh, that's right.
I should go report that to
Eggbert.<>

Commander Morgan?!<>

Hey you!
Cover me, I'm departing.<>

Whaaat?
But under these circumstances...<>

We still have an ace up
our sleeve. Don't worry,
and keep fighting.<>

Then why are you fleeing the
battle, Commander Morgan?<>

Damnit! SHUT UP!
I'm not escaping!<clsr>
I just have a report to
make.<clsr>
Now hurry and get back to
fighting!<>

No way...<>

Even with Vargas here,
the situation worsens...
... hrm.<clsr>
I don't want to die here... <clsr>
I wonder what can I do...<>

Even Vargas retreated. It
won't help anyway if
I stay... <clsr>
I don't want to die here... <clsr>
I wonder what can I do in
this situation...<>

Well then, I'm leaving.
Hyahahaha...<>

Eek!
You caught up with me
already?!<>

Gya ha ha!
Let me thank you
for our previous<clsr>
encounter...<>

Urgh...
This pain, pain... aagh!...
Can't stop bleeding!...<clsr>
Gah...
Eggbert...!<>

Damn. Him too.<>

Now, go!<clsr>
You teach them a lesson!<>

Yes!<>

Damnit!
Stop following me!<clsr>
Fight those idiots and buy
time for me to retreat!<clsr>
Or you'll regret it.<>

Y.. yes...<>

Let's go!<>

Kyaa!<>

Eh? What feeble
subordinates!<>

Hmmm, those kids are doing
quite well.<clsr>
I never expected them to
corner my troops.<>

No way...
I can't believe Kalxath
Castle has fallen...<>

Damn! I was too late...<>

Hahaha! Well done!
You're excellent soldiers!<>

Ouch!<clsr>
I wouldn't have come with
them if I'd known this would
happen.<>

Hein, what are you saying?
You're a man aren't you?
Hang in there!<>

Well, Cherie, you're all
right because you're as
strong as most men.<clsr>
But I'm just not good at
these kinds of things.<>

How cruel!
I'll never ever help you
again Hein, even if you need it!<>

I can't be beaten here!<>

Pri.. Princess?!<>

I'm all right!
A scratch like that
won't kill me.<>

For God's sake, please don't
fight too much. I can't let
our princess die here...<>

What are you saying?<clsr>
I won't leave battle while
others are still fighting
desparatly!<>

Kya!<>

Damn it!
Liana's in danger!
Everyone, defend her!<>

Such power is to be expected
of the Empire... <clsr>
But we won't lose either!<>

Shit, you are doing quite
well.<>

You've already lost!<>

You did very well.<clsr>
You protected this castle
from the attack of the
Blazing Dragon Army.<>

To think that even a girl
like me could fight, too.<clsr>
I can't stand having to
remain here while others
fight!<clsr>
Erwin, please!<>

Nobody's hurt?<>

Anyway, we came out safe.<>

Thanks to Erwin we were able
to endure this attack.<>

Princess...
We should thank Erwin.<>

I guess so... <clsr>
Huh...
Where'd it go...??<clsr>
Sorry, I think I gave it to
someone. I don't have it
with me.<>

Do I already have it?<clsr>
Was it... a dream?<>

Right.<clsr>
There's a suit of armor.<clsr>
It is said our ancestors
used this.<clsr>
It's probably not the best,
but it's very light and
provides good defense.<>

Obtained Dragonscale!<>

Thanks to you, I was saved.<>

Thanks to you, I was saved.<>

I'm sorry, Princess, I
have no excuse.<>

It's alright, Keith.<clsr>
You saved the castle from
the attack of the Blazing
Dragon Army.<>

Isn't Kalxath an enormous
castle...?<clsr>
Maybe its walls
protect Liana if she were to
stay here?<>

Of course! Leave it to me!<>

Well...
I fulfilled my duty.<clsr>
I must return to the village
now.<>

Well...
It seems my current power
wasn't any help.<clsr>
I should return to the
village to train more.<>

No way! I'll never learn
strategy if Scott leaves now!<>

Damn, but I have no choice.<clsr>
I'll have to study the
affinity of each troop by
myself.<>

Well then, take care...<>

Scott left the party.<>

Sir Erwin, a guest came, and
he says he would like to see
you.<>

Sir Erwin, a guest came, and
he says he would like to see
you.<>

Glad to see you again,
Erwin.<>

Priest!<>

I thought I should
investigate an old
manuscript in the shrine... <clsr>
I found the hidden power of
the evil sword Alhazard.<>

That's good. But what kind
of power is it?<>

A fearful power seems to
be within Alhazard.<clsr>
Not only does it raise its
user's physical and
mental power,<clsr>
but allows him contact the
demon world.<>

The demon world?!
No magician on this continent
is powerful enough to do that.<>

That's right.<clsr>
But this manuscript says
that the sword can summon
the Dark Rod,<clsr>
one of the items capable of
commanding demons.<>

The Dark Rod? They say just
one blast from it is enough
to destroy a city!<>

If that were used, we
wouldn't have any way to
resist.<clsr>
Is there any way to avoid it?<>

To tell the truth, Alhazard
has not completely revived
yet.<clsr>
The Dark Rod is necessary to
completely revive it.<>

I see...<clsr>
That's why the Imperial Army
searches for that scroll so
desparatly.<>

But couldn't Alhazard just
be used without the Dark
Rod?...<>

I don't think so. I still
don't know where the Dark
Rod is.<>

Let's go to the Rall River,
then.<clsr>
It's said that a powerful
magician has been living
there for several hundred
years.<clsr>
If anyone knows anything
about that Dark Rod, it
would be her.<clsr>
Erwin, let's go together!<>

Aren't you concerned about
staying to defend Kalxath?<>

The Empire's plans are
the top priority now.<clsr>
When the power of Alhazad
is release, this castle
won't matter anymore.<>

That's right. I'm going too.<>

What? You're coming too?<>

Of course! My job is to
defend the princess.<>

Keith joined the party!<>

Then you'll be heading for
the river now...<>

We can't just let the
do as it pleases.<>

We should go as soon as possible.<>

I'll lend a hand too!
I want to see this legendary
magician!<clsr>
I wonder what kind of person
they are?<>

Ok.
Troops, get ready to go.<>

Yes sir!<>

Let's hurry!<clsr>
We have to obtain the Dark Rod
before the Empire.<>

Erwin...<>

What is it?<clsr>
Stay here so the people
of the castle can protect
you.<clsr>
You don't have to
worry about anything.<>

That's right, make yourself
at home.<>

No, that's not it... <clsr>
I want go with you.<>

What!
It's dangerous!<>

...<>

Erwin, don't worry.<clsr>
It's probably not that dangerous
around the Rall River... <clsr>
Or don't you think you can protect her?<>

...<>

... fine.
However, promise me
one thing.<clsr>
If we fight against
the Empire, you have go back
to Kalxath.<clsr>
Alright?<>

Thank you. Sorry for
asking for something
so unreasonable<>

Princess, I'm ready.<>

Well then, let's move out!<>

Caught up, at last!<>

Shit!
Why did we fail to
take Kalxath..?<>

How are you, Zorum? I was
worried.<>

I'm sorry, General Vargas.<clsr>
We failed to acquire
the stone tablet, and we
also couldn't lure the
Kalxath army away from home.<>

... don't worry,what's done is
done.<clsr>
Concentrate on taking
Kalxath Castle now.<>

Yes sir!<>

Hyahahaha...
I have an interesting story
for you, General Vargas.<clsr>
The young girl, Liana, that
the Blue Dragon Knights
are after is here too.<clsr>
We're lucky - we can catch
her and capture the
castle... <clsr>
Hyahahaha!<>

My orders are only to capture
Kalxath Castle.<clsr>
I have no interest in this
girl, Liana.
I'll leave her to you!<>

Hyahahaha!
I can't believe you don't
want her!<clsr>
I'll take her then.<>

Seems that the General has
withdrawn.<clsr>
We have no choice then but
to take this girl to the
Imperial capital by
ourselves.<>

It seems that the main
forces have withdrawn.<clsr>
We have no choice then but
to take this girl to the
Imperial capital by
ourselves.<>

For once we have the same
opinion.<clsr>
Okay, Morgan, let's go!<>

Hehehe!!<>

Yeah...
you can't depend on
others forever.<>

I really must leave.
Well then...<>
