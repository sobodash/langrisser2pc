You must find stronger allies to
help you.<clsr>
Against the Empire, it is
impossible even for me to
protect Liana...<>

To aim for Liana, the empire must
have some special goal in mind.<clsr>
The Empire has been invading every
neighboring land that it has not
occupied...<>

I agree.<clsr>
But the empire may not be able to
get their hands on her at the
shrine of light in Estool.<>

That's right!<clsr>
The great Shinto Priest who lives
there will surely help us.<>

I'm sorry, everyone.
Because of me...<>

It's not your fault!<clsr>
Besides, the journey is too
dangerous for you to travel alone,
Liana.<>

I want to know why the Empire
is after Liana.<clsr>
Since I have a purpose now, I no
longer have to go on an aimless
journey.<>

Thank you, everyone!<>

Well then, father.
I shall leave now.<>

It is a great opportunity for you
to learn.<clsr>
Study well, and spread your
knowledge.<>

Erwin, I entrust to you Liana's
well being.<clsr>
Scott, look after her as well...<>

I understand, father.<>

All right!
Then let's depart now!<>

!!
Someone is here!<>

There they are!
They did not get very far!<>

Ah!
It's the Blue Dragon Knights!<>

The Blue Dragon Knights' objective
is to capture Liana.<clsr>
If you value your lives, then do
not get in our way!<>

....<>

Liana!
Don't listen to them!<>

Hein is right!<clsr>
It is unnecessary for you to give
in to the demands of the Imperial
Army.<>

You are trespassing in my
territory.<clsr>
The Imperial Army has no business
here!
Leave now!<>

So you think you can oppose us?
In that case, we'll take her by
force!<>

I'll stop them here.<clsr>
You guys head north.... Estool is
just across the road!<clsr>
Do not worry about me!
There is no time!
Hurry!<>

If I can't protect Liana...<>

I will take care of the Lord.
The rest of you, go after the
girl!<>

Yes, sir!<>

Understood!<>

As you command!<>

Liana!
Break through, and run for it!!<>

Okay!<>

Do you want to change the movement
orders for Liana?<>

Please specify Liana's movement
orders.<>

They're enduring longer than I
thought!<clsr>
Don't let her get away!<>

Hein, can you use attack magic?<clsr>
It can temporarily increase the
attack power of a hired troop unit
for a single turn.<>

Ah, of course.<clsr>
You won't see me as a fool when it
comes to support magic.<>

.... I reached the goal.<>

Good, you've done well.
Estool is just a stretch away
across that road!<>

Right!<>

It's hopeless.
I must withdraw...<>

I can't believe we managed to
elude the Imperial Army again...<>

You're doing well!
Keep running towards that stretch
of road!<>

You're doing well!
Keep running towards that stretch
of road!<>

You're doing well!
Keep running towards that stretch
of road!<>

You're doing well!
You're almost there!<>

Okay!<>

In the middle of the woods, there
is a plaza with small footprints
here and there.<clsr>
One set of foot prints lead to a
hole...<>

Do you wish to search in the hole?<>

Speedboots discovered!<>

On top of a hill stands a large,
mysterious tree. Under the tree,
you see a strange fruit.<>

Will you eat the fruit?<>

You feel a surge of power
flowing through your body!<clsr>
AT raised by 1!<>

Here I come!!<>

It's going to take more than that
to stop us!
We'll defend Liana to the end!!<>

You should have listened to us
obediently.<>

To be defeated before being able
to protect Liana...<>

Everything was peaceful until you
bastards showed up...<>

Okay, mission complete.
Let's return to base.<>

No, get away from me!<>

Liana!<>

For it to end like this...
Only if I had more power...<>

Unfortunately, we are no match
for them with our current
strength.<clsr>
I will take care of this.
The rest of you should hurry to
Estool.<>

Don't stand in my way!<>

Ah!
If I was only stronger!<>

It's payback time!<>

Now then...
It's up to the younger generation
to fight this war.<clsr>
As long as I'm alive I won't let
the enemy reach the shrine.<clsr>
I need to buy Scott more time to
gain fighting experience.<>

Now then...
It's up to the younger generation
to fight this war.<clsr>
As long as I'm alive I won't let
the enemy reach the shrine.<>

How dreadful, to permit such scum
to roam freely in my territory!<>

.... I am done for.<>

Father!
You can't fight anymore in your
condition!<clsr>
Please retire.<>

You'll have to take over for me.
Get Liana to safety.<>

Ok!
I'll chase the girl now!<>

Who shall I go after?<>

I'll go after them.<>

How ludicrous!
Do you really think that you can
beat me?!<>

I go where my sword leads me!<>

Sir Leon!<>

General Leon!<clsr>
A group of monsters are attacking
villages around the nation's
border!<clsr>
Villagers are taking heavy
casualties!<>

What!
The village I was raised in may
be in danger.<clsr>
I must go back to protect my
home...<>

Leyad!<clsr>
I'll leave you in charge.
I must hurry to the village.<>

I understand.<clsr>
But, will you be all right by
yourself, sir Leon?<>

I can handle the monsters by
myself.<clsr>
You are to carry out your orders!<>

Understood!<>

Bullsh....
How can I lose to such...<>

They're getting away!<>

We're under imperial orders.
This is the final warning.
Do not get in our way!<>

It will never go as you planned.
I will stop you at all costs!<>

You're a fool.
Do you think you can stop us from
crossing the road?<clsr>
Don't throw away your life!<>

You'll have to defeat me to go
any further.<clsr>
Even if you're with the Blue
Dragon Knights, I won't be
so easily defeated!<>

Interesting...
In that case, die!<>

.. It's, it's not over
yet...<>

.. I musn't lose, I must...<>

.. It's not over yet. I..<>

.. I can't believe it..<>

.. How can I lose?...<>

I lost?! How can I...<>

Damn...
How can I fail... <clsr>
General Leon, whether I am allowed
to or not,... <clsr>
I must disengage!<>

You dare interfere?!
I'll kill you quickly!<>

One, once again...
I am defeated by you...
Damn!<>

Shit!
They are too strong...<>

How, how can I...<>

I am glad to have served for the
glory of the empire!<>

General... Leon!<>

Such...
How can I make such a mistake...<>

It's a lie...
To be defeated like this.<>

Shit...
How can I lose with my tactical
advantage...?!<>

Uraa!<>

Kyaa!<>

Liana!
Are you okay?<>

... I, I think so...<>

Everyone!
Protect Liana!<>

At any rate, let's hurry!
More Imperial reinforcements may
come at any time.<>

Do you want her to go north along
the road by herself?<>

Liana,
head north along the road!<>

O, okay!<>

Liana, you'll be safe with me.<>

Do you want her to try and go to
Erwin's side?<>

Really?!
Thank you, Erwin.<>

Even if we run into trouble,
I'll protect you with my life!<clsr>
Try not to leave my side!<>

Okay!<>

I'll escort her to safety.<>

Do you want her to try and go to
Hein's side?<>

Thank you, Hein.
If I go with Erwin, I'll only get
in the way.<>

I'm counting on you then, Hein!<>

Of course, I'll protect her with
my life!<>

Why don't you follow me, then?<>

Do you want her to try and go to
Scott's side?<>

I appreciate your kindness.<>

Take good care of her.<>

All right, leave her to me!<>

Get them!<>

Shit!
It's am ambush!<>

I'll slow them down!
You must break through them!<clsr>
Don't let them harm Liana!<>

Surround them!
They have no chance, now that
we're here!<>

Oh, Shit!
More Imperial soldiers!..<>

Damn!
If only I could last a little
longer...<>

Someone's coming!<>

What's going on here?<clsr>
Why would the Imperial Army want
to bully a group of weaklings?<>

You bastard!
Don't interfere unless you wish
to die by my blade!<>

I'm busy, but I'll help you fight
against the Imperial Army.<clsr>
Here's a nickel's worth of free
advice.<clsr>
You, the red head!
Never act selfishly, and don't
be reckless!<>

.... who is he?
Where do you think he's from?
He's not with the Imperial Army...<>

He's a mercenary.
But, why....?<>

Wait, stranger!
You have not told me your business
yet!<clsr>
... too late, he left already.<>

How unfortunate!
I didn't get to hear the story
behind the men I killed...<>

Thank you for helping us.<clsr>
My name is Erwin.
Who are you?<>

I'm Rohga.
What does the Empire want with the
girl?<>

We don't know either.<clsr>
Until we find out, we must get
her to safety for now.. <clsr>
For Liana's sake...<>

Hmmmm... <clsr>
Well, I cannot tell you much about
myself in detail for personal
reasons. Maybe in the future
you'll find out.<clsr>
Anyway, I bet it's quite annoying
with the Empire chasing after you.<>

I guess so.
Anyway, we need to hurry!<>

It seems so.
Anyway, we have to leave!<>

Where are you headed?<clsr>
If you're going to Estool, then
we're headed in the same
direction.<clsr>
From the looks of this fight,
I don't think you're in the clear
yet.<clsr>
How about I come along and lend
you a hand?<>

I see... well then, we would
greatly appreciate your help!<>

Whew, it's finally over...<>

The Imperial Army won't give up
that easily though.<>

Ah... when will it all end?<>

Cough...
Is the Imperial Army gone?<>

It's safe now.
They retreated.<>

Damn!
I can't die right now.
Please have mercy...<>

You're going to be okay.
My name is Erwin.<>

I'm Rohga.
I was in search of someone when...<clsr>
... the soldiers from the Imperial
Army... aaaahhh!<>

Please try not to move.
Your wound is bad...<>

Why not come with us until your
wound gets better?<>

.... but, you may get in trouble.<clsr>
The empire hasn't given up its
hunt for you.
In my state, it would be hard to
survive another confrontation.<clsr>
I appreciate your offer, but I
can't accept.<>

We're wanted by the Empire.
We don't want to get you involved
in this mess...<>

.... that's right...<>

Did you forget that the Empire is
after Liana?<>

.... I wish you luck, then.<>

Wait.
I have something for you.
Take this sword.<>

Great Sword received!<>

Thanks,
I'll take good care of it.<>

We should watch out along the way.<>

We should stay alert.<>

As you say, father.<>

Sir Leyad!<clsr>
If something should happen to
you, General Leon would be very
displeased.
Please withdraw for now!<>
